# friend_finder

Friend Finder is an application that matches two users based upon their answers to a ten question survey. The questions attempt to gauge the users personality with questions on a scale of 1 to 5 that judges their feelings toward a certain topic. The application then compares the answers of the current user to all the other users and matches them with the most compatible user.
